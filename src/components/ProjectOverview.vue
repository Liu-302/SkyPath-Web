    <h3>The Drone Explorer: Immersive Visualization for UAV Mission Planning</h3>
    <p>
      SkyPath enables users to analyze, simulate, and refine UAV flight paths
      and viewpoints interactively in a 3D environment. It bridges the gap
      between algorithmic path generation and human-guided mission design.
